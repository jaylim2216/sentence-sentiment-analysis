# Sentiment Analysis Project

**Overview**

This Jupyter notebook is designed to perform sentiment analysis on a dataset of sentences
extracted from movie reviews. The goal is to classify each sentence as having a positive or
negative sentiment. We shall use Support Vector Machines and Logistic Regression for this
notebook.

**Dataset**

The dataset consists of 10,662 sentences, each labeled '1' (positive review) or '0' (negative
review). The data file is titled `dataset.csv`.

**Usage**

To use this notebook:

1. Ensure that the `dataset.csv` file is available in the same folder as the notebook.
2. Run the cells in order to preprocess the data, train the model, and evaluate its performance.
3. Use the `predict_sentiment` function to analyze the sentiment of new sentences.

**Requirements**

- Python 3
- Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab
- Libraries: `matplotlib`, `nltk`, `numpy`, `scikit-learn`

**How to Run**

1. Start the Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab server.
2. Open the `IT1244_Coding_Project.ipynb` notebook.
3. Run the notebook cells sequentially from top to bottom.
